  </div>
</div>

**What it is:**  
EY-009 is a large heavy-lift carrier drone designed to transport and deploy secondary aircraft or payloads. The core challenge is achieving high stiffness and payload capacity while staying lightweight and manufacturable with student-team resources.

**What I did:**  
- Led system-level structural design and full CAD integration.  
- Designed motor mounts, structural frame modules, and electronics mounting architecture.  
- Drove manufacturing through CNC milling and 3D-printed iteration cycles.  
- Solved tight packaging constraints for power, avionics, and battery placement.  
- Coordinated cross-subteam integration and flight-test readiness.  

**Outcome / next steps:**  
The team achieved a complete, flyable carrier platform after multiple design-manufacture-test loops. Current work focuses on refining payload interfaces and improving modularity for rapid reconfiguration.

    <p style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85; margin-top:0.4rem;">CAD / aerodynamic detail of the high-speed configuration.</p>
  </div>
</div>

**What it is:**  
Lawndart is CUAD’s speed-focused platform aimed at extreme top-end performance. The design balances aerodynamic drag reduction, structural stiffness under high dynamic loads, and propulsion packaging.

**What I did:**  
- Helped lead the CAD architecture for the airframe and aero-critical geometry.  
- Iterated structural layouts to maximize stiffness-to-weight.  
- Integrated propulsion and electronics under tight volume constraints.  
- Worked through manufacturability tradeoffs to keep geometry realistic to build.  
- Helped define test-iteration priorities based on performance goals.  

**Outcome / next steps:**  
The platform is progressing through iterative aerodynamic and structural refinements to push speed performance. Next steps include continued weight optimization and flight-test validation toward record-level targets.

    <p style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85; margin-top:0.4rem;">Design in progress — imagery coming soon.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex:1; min-width:220px;">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/Skyhawk.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Glider surveillance drone - concept"
         style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);">
    <p style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.85; margin-top:0.4rem;">Deployable fixed-wing glider surveillance concept.</p>
  </div>
</div>

**What it is:**  
This concept is a fully 3d printed missile-style autonomous glider intended for rapid deployment and long-range glide-phase surveillance. Key challenges include weight reduction, reliable wing lift, and stable fixed-wing control during glide.

**What I did:**  
- Developed electrical configuration and helped with CAD for reliability and strength.  
- Evaluated tail and wing layout options for glide stability and control authority.  
- Planned payload bay integration around real mass/volume constraints.  
- Drove concept trade studies to align mission requirements with buildability.  

**Outcome / next steps:**  
The airframe is in active development, with focus on finalizing deployable mechanisms and validating stability/controls assumptions before prototype build.
